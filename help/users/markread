MARKREAD <target> [timestamp=<ts>]

Queries or sets the read-marker position for a channel or
private conversation. Requires the draft/read-marker capability.

Without a timestamp, queries the stored marker:
  MARKREAD #channel

With a timestamp, updates the marker:
  MARKREAD #channel timestamp=2026-02-19T12:00:00.000Z

Timestamps are monotonically increasing; stale updates are
ignored and the server replies with the newer stored value.

On channel JOIN the server automatically sends a MARKREAD.
Markers are stored in-memory and lost on disconnect.
