TAGMSG <target>

Sends a message carrying only tags (no text body) to the
specified channel or user. Requires the message-tags
capability to be negotiated.

TAGMSG respects standard channel permissions: you must
be able to send to the channel, and normal flood control
applies. Only recipients with message-tags negotiated
will see the message.

Common uses include typing indicators (+draft/typing).
