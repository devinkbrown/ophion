SETNAME :<new realname>

Changes your realname (GECOS field). Requires the setname
capability to be negotiated.

The new realname must not exceed REALLEN characters. The
change is broadcast to users sharing a channel with you
who have the setname capability negotiated.

If the realname is too long, the server replies with:
  FAIL SETNAME INVALID_REALNAME :Realname is too long
