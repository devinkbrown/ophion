IRCv3 standard-replies capability
----------------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/standard-replies

The standard-replies capability indicates that the client understands
the FAIL, WARN, and NOTE message formats.  These provide a structured
way for the server to communicate errors, warnings, and informational
messages that don't fit neatly into the traditional numeric reply
system.

Capability name: standard-replies
Registered in: ircd/s_serv.c
