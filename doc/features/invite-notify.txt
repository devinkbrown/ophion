IRCv3 invite-notify capability
-------------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/invite-notify

The invite-notify capability allows channel members to be notified
when another user is invited to the channel.

Capability name: invite-notify
Registered in: ircd/s_serv.c
Implementation: modules/m_invite.c

When a user with invite-notify negotiated is in a channel and someone
is INVITEd to that channel, they receive an INVITE message:

  :inviter!user@host INVITE invitee #channel

Only channel operators and half-operators receive invite-notify
messages by default.  The notification is sent to members who have
the invite-notify capability negotiated.
