draft/read-marker capability and MARKREAD command
==================================================

Module: m_read_marker

The draft/read-marker extension allows clients to synchronise the
last-read position of a channel or private-message conversation
across multiple sessions.

Spec: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/read-marker

Capability
----------

Clients negotiate the "draft/read-marker" capability during CAP.

MARKREAD command
----------------

  MARKREAD <target>
    Query the stored read-marker timestamp for <target>.
    The server replies:
      :<server> MARKREAD <target> <timestamp>
    or if no marker is stored:
      :<server> MARKREAD <target> *

  MARKREAD <target> timestamp=<ISO 8601>
    Set the read-marker timestamp for <target>.
    Timestamps are monotonically increasing: if the supplied timestamp
    is older than or equal to the stored value, the server replies with
    the existing (newer) stored value and discards the update.

Automatic behaviour
-------------------

On channel JOIN, the server sends a MARKREAD for the channel to
clients that have negotiated draft/read-marker.

Storage
-------

Markers are stored in-memory per-connection.  They are lost when the
client disconnects or the server restarts.

Error replies
-------------

  FAIL MARKREAD NEED_MORE_PARAMS :Missing parameters
  FAIL MARKREAD INVALID_PARAMS <target> :Invalid parameters
