IRCv3 message-tags capability
-----------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-tags

The message-tags capability enables clients to send and receive
arbitrary key-value metadata attached to IRC messages using the IRCv3
message tags format.

When negotiated, the client may receive message tags on any server-sent
message.  The client may also use the TAGMSG command to send a message
that carries only tags and no text body.

Capability name: message-tags
Module: cap_message_tags

TAGMSG command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  TAGMSG <target>

Sends a message consisting solely of tags (no text body) to the given
target.  The target may be a channel or a nickname.

TAGMSG respects all standard channel permissions:
- The sender must be able to send to the channel (can_send() check).
- Channels with +n (no external messages) require membership.
- Channels with +m (moderated) require voice or operator status.
- Normal flood control and target-change limits apply.

Only clients that have negotiated the message-tags capability will
receive TAGMSG messages.

Example:

  C: @+draft/typing=active TAGMSG #channel
  S: @+draft/typing=active :nick!user@host TAGMSG #channel

Common uses include typing indicators (+draft/typing) and message
reactions (+draft/react).
