IRCv3 setname capability
------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/setname

The setname capability allows clients to change their realname (GECOS
field) after connection registration.  The client must negotiate the
setname capability before using the SETNAME command.

Capability name: setname
Module: m_setname

SETNAME command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  SETNAME :<new realname>

Changes the sender's realname.  The new value must not exceed REALLEN
characters.  On success, the change is:

1. Echoed back to the sender:
   :nick!user@host SETNAME :new realname

2. Broadcast to users sharing a channel who have the setname capability:
   :nick!user@host SETNAME :new realname

3. Propagated to other servers via ENCAP:
   :<uid> ENCAP * SETNAME :new realname

Errors
~~~~~~

If the realname is too long:
  :server FAIL SETNAME INVALID_REALNAME :Realname is too long

If the client has not negotiated the setname capability:
  :server 421 nick SETNAME :Unknown command
