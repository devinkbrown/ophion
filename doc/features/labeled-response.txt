IRCv3 labeled-response capability
----------------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/labeled-response

The labeled-response capability allows clients to associate server
responses with the command that triggered them.  The client sends a
label tag on a command; the server echoes that label on all responses
to that command.

Capability name: labeled-response
Registered in: ircd/s_serv.c
Implementation: ircd/parse.c, ircd/send.c

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client attaches a label tag to a command:

  @label=abc123 PRIVMSG #channel :hello

The server includes the same label on all responses:

  @label=abc123 :nick!user@host PRIVMSG #channel :hello

If the command produces no visible response, the server sends an ACK:

  @label=abc123 :server ACK

The label tag is extracted during message parsing (ircd/parse.c) and
injected into outgoing messages via sendto_one_prefix() and
sendto_one_notice() (ircd/send.c).

Labels are only echoed to the originating client and only when the
client has negotiated the labeled-response capability.
