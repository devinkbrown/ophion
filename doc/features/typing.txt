IRCv3 typing capability (draft)
--------------------------------

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/client-tags/typing

The draft/typing capability enables typing indicator notifications
between clients.

Capability name: draft/typing
Registered in: ircd/s_serv.c

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients that negotiate both message-tags and draft/typing can send
typing indicators using TAGMSG with the +draft/typing client tag:

  @+draft/typing=active TAGMSG <target>

The tag value may be:
  active   The user is actively typing.
  paused   The user started typing but stopped.
  done     The user has cleared their input.

Since +draft/typing is a client-only tag (prefixed with +), it is
already relayed by the message-tags module (cap_message_tags) via
TAGMSG.  The draft/typing capability registration simply advertises
to clients that the server understands this tag.
